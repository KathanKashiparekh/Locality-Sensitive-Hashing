# Locality-Sensitive-Hashing
This repository contains all the code developed for my Computer Science study oriented project.

- LSH.py is a basic implementation of Minhashing and Locality Sensitive Hashing to calculate possible candidate pairs.
- LSH_2.py extend LSH.py by calculating Minhash Jaccard values for various sizes of items and varying true Jaccard similarity.
  Results are displayed as a matrix with rows being array sizes and columns being true Jaccard values. (Yes/No) in each box indicates
  if the two arrays are seen as a candidate pair by the LSH algorithm.
